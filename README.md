## PoxPulse is now open source! 

I have not had the time to keep this project updated and maintained for years. If anyone would like to pick it up and contribute, I will review code changes via pull request and continue to host at www.poxpulse.com.

Be warned: the code is almost entirely undocumented/uncommented and half a decade old. **Please do not expect quality!** This was put together early in my career and rather hastily.

For anyone interested, the greatest contribution would likely be a self contained update script using the new JSON API provided by Desert Owl Games. The current version uses the old XML feed, and all of the image and icon data had to be entered manually. A decent parser using the new API could be setup on a chronjob and run automatically!

The old rune displays don't really make sense now, either.
